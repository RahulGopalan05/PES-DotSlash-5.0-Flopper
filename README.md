## Two Way Sign Language Transcriber with Emotion Recognition

This project was developed during the PES DotSLash 5.0 Hackathon, a 24-hour coding competition. I created a two-way sign language transcriber capable of converting hand signs to text or speech, and vice versa. Additionally, we integrated emotion recognition to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Sign to Text/Voice**: Utilize `sign-textvoice.py` to translate hand signs captured through a camera into text or speech.
- **Text to Sign/Voice**: Use `text-signvoice.py` to convert text input into corresponding hand signs or speech.
- **Emotion Recognition**: The `Facial-recognition-model.py` script provides emotion recognition functionality, detecting facial expressions.

## Main Files

- **`sign-textvoice.py`**: Translates hand signs to text or speech.
- **`text-signvoice.py`**: Converts text input to hand signs or speech.
- **`Facial-recognition-model.py`**: Implements emotion recognition using facial expressions.
- **`Flopperwebsite`**: Frontend folder containing the website interface. Note that this frontend has not yet been integrated with the backend scripts.
